// Problem F: Hamster Kombat

/*
Problem Description:
The task is to determine the exact number of clicks required for the Hamster to give the desired answer.
The input is not directly provided but involves interacting with a webpage's element representing the Hamster.
Output is the answer text provided by the Hamster after receiving the correct number of clicks.

Manual Steps:
1. Open the target webpage in your browser.
2. Open the developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
3. Navigate to the "Console" tab.
4. Copy and paste the code below into the console.
5. Observe the output and adjust the number of clicks using a binary search approach for efficiency.

// Locate the hamster element on the webpage
// This assumes the hamster is identified by the ID 'hamster'
hamsterElement = document.getElementById('hamster');

// Binary search to optimize the number of clicks
let left = 0;             // Minimum possible clicks
let right = 100000;       // Start with a large maximum limit
let clicks = 0;           // Variable to store the exact number of clicks

while (left <= right) {
    // Calculate the mid-point of the current range
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    console.log(`Trying with ${mid} clicks.`);
    
    // Simulate clicks on the hamster element
    for (let i = 0; i < mid; i++) {
        hamsterElement.click();
    }
    
    // Retrieve the output provided by the Hamster
    // Adjust the selector if necessary based on the webpage structure
    let result = hamsterElement.innerText || document.querySelector('.output-class').innerText;
    console.log(`Result after ${mid} clicks: ${result}`);
    
    // Check the result and adjust the search range
    if (result === "desired answer") {  // Replace "desired answer" with the actual expected answer
        clicks = mid;                   // Found the correct number of clicks
        break;
    } else if (/* Check if more clicks are needed */) {
        left = mid + 1;                 // Increase the lower bound
    } else {
        right = mid - 1;                // Decrease the upper bound
    }
}

// Output the exact number of clicks required
console.log(`Exact number of clicks required: ${clicks}`);
