# Independence-Cup-Armenian-Open-Programming-Contest

This repository contains solutions to selected problems from the Independence Cup (Armenian Open Programming Contest). I have included detailed explanations and code implementations for each solved problem.  Feel free to explore, contribute, or use as a reference.
## Problem List

Here are the problems I have solved and included in this repository:

- **Problem A**
- **Problem B**
- **Problem E1**
- **Problem E2**
- **Problem F**
- **Problem K1**
