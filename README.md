# Independence-Cup-Armenian-Open-Programming-Contest

This repository contains solutions to selected problems from the Independence Cup (Armenian Open Programming Contest). I have included detailed explanations and code implementations for each solved problem.  Feel free to explore, contribute, or use as a reference.
## Problem List

Here are the problems I have solved and included in this repository:

- **Problem A**
- **Problem B**
- **Problem E1**
- **Problem E2**
- **Problem F**
- **Problem K1**
- **Problem K2**

Each solution includes:
- A description of the problem statement
- A detailed approach to the solution
- The code implementation
- Analysis of the solutionâ€™s efficiency and possible improvements

## Repository Structure

Each problem is located in a separate Jupyter notebook, making it easy to follow the logic and code for each solution. The structure is as follows:
